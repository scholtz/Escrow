This is your workspace root. A `workspace` in AlgoKit is an orchestrated collection of standalone projects (backends, smart contracts, frontend apps and etc).

By default, `projects_root_path` parameter is set to `projects`. Which instructs AlgoKit CLI to create a new directory under `projects` directory when new project is instantiated via `algokit init` at the root of the workspace.

## Getting Started

To get started refer to `README.md` files in respective sub-projects in the `projects` directory.

Go to [Escrow README.md](projects/Escrow/README.md)
